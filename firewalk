ðŸ”¹ What is Firewalk?

    -Firewalk is an active network reconnaissance tool that determines which Layer-4 (TCP/UDP) protocols a router or firewall will forward.

    -It does this by sending packets with a TTL set to expire one hop beyond the gateway; if the packet is forwarded and then expires at the next hop you get an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED reply â€” if the gateway drops the packet because of ACLs/firewall rules you get no reply.

    -This allows you to infer which ports/protocols the gateway is permitting.

ðŸ”¹ Why use Firewalk?

    -Map firewall/ACL behavior â€” find which protocols and ports are allowed through a gateway without doing a full port scan behind it.


    -Validate network policies â€” check if firewall rules match intended security policy (useful in audits and pentests).


    -Low-noise reconnaissance â€” compared to some scans it focuses on ACL/protocol pass/block behavior and can be less intrusive if used carefully.

ðŸ”¹ How to install?

Kali usually includes Firewalk in its tools repository. Install or confirm with:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install firewalk

ðŸ”¹How â€” Basic usage & common options

Run firewalk --help or check the man page on your system for exact flags. The general command form is:

    firewalk [options] <gateway> <target>

(you supply the gateway/router you believe is filtering, and a downstream host or address to use as the expiration/metric).

ðŸ”¹ Common useful options (flag names may vary slightly by version):

    1. -p <protocol> â€” protocol to test (TCP, UDP, or ICMP).

    2. -S <start-end> â€” destination port or port range to probe (for TCP/UDP).

    3. -i <iface> â€” network interface to use.

    4. -d <startport> â€” ramping / source port start (some examples use this to avoid rate limiting).

    5. -n â€” numeric output / skip DNS lookups.

    6. -v / -D â€” verbose / debugging output
