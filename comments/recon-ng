üîé What is Recon-ng?

    -Recon-ng is a web reconnaissance framework written in Python.

    -It provides a modular environment (like Metasploit but for reconnaissance) where you can collect information about a target using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).

    -It comes with modules for:

        Domain name information

        WHOIS lookups

        DNS records

        Subdomain enumeration

        Geolocation data

        Social media accounts

        Data breach information

üéØ Why use Recon-ng?

    Automates and simplifies the information gathering phase of penetration testing.

    Instead of running many different tools manually, Recon-ng integrates them in one framework.

    Helps ethical hackers, security researchers, and penetration testers to:

    Map the attack surface of a domain.

    Collect data without alerting the target (passive reconnaissance).

    Save results in workspaces for reporting and analysis.

    Use APIs from services like Shodan, Virustotal, Bing, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Use Recon-ng in Kali Linux?

1. Start Recon-ng

   recon-ng

You‚Äôll see a Metasploit-like CLI prompt.

2. Create a Workspace

Helps you organize your recon for each project:

    workspaces create target_project

3. Set a Target

For example, to add a domain:

    modules load recon/domains-hosts/bing_domain_web
    options set SOURCE example.com
    run

4. Explore Available Modules

List all modules:

show modules

Categories include:

    recon/domains-\* ‚Üí domain enumeration

    recon/hosts-\* ‚Üí host information

    recon/contacts-\* ‚Üí email and people lookup

    reporting/\* ‚Üí generate reports

5. Use API Keys (Optional but Powerful)

Some modules need API keys (like Shodan, Virustotal, etc.).
Set them like this:

    keys add shodan_api YOUR_API_KEY

6. Generate Reports

After running multiple modules:

    modules load reporting/html
    options set FILENAME /root/Desktop/report.html
    run

This creates a full recon report.
