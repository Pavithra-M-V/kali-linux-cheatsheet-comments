ðŸ”¹What is maltego-teeth?

        maltego-teeth (often called Maltego Teeth) is a package of Maltego transforms that allow you to run active tools (nmap, sqlmap, Metasploit, etc.) from inside the Maltego graphing/OSINT GUI.

ðŸ”¹Why use it?

        -Streamlines reconnaissance â†’ active testing: run scans (e.g., nmap) or sqlmap against entities discovered in Maltego without leaving the graph.

        -Faster correlation: results feed back into the graph as new entities/links, helping analysts visually connect findings.

        -Good for red-team / pen testers who want a visual, reproducible workflow combining OSINT and targeted scans. (Always use only on assets youâ€™re authorized to test.)

ðŸ”¹How to install (Kali)?

Update and install package:

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install maltego-teeth

ðŸ”¹How to get it working in Maltego (quick steps)

        -Open Maltego (you need Maltego installed and licensed/registered as required).

        -Load the Teeth config: import the provided Maltego transforms/config file. The Kali packaging notes a config at /opt/Teeth/etc/Maltego_config.mtz â€” load that into Maltego (File â†’ Import â†’ Transform/Config).


        -Run transforms from the graph: right-click an entity (IP, domain, person) and youâ€™ll see new Teeth transforms (e.g., Run nmap, Run sqlmap). Execute them â€” the transform may spawn a local scan and return results as Maltego

        Review & enrich: results appear on the graph; click to inspect details or run follow-on transforms.

ðŸ”¹Example (typical workflow)

        -Domain â†’ (Teeth DNS/OSINT transforms) â†’ Host/IP entity â†’ right-click â†’ Teeth:nmap scan â†’ new "Open port" entities

        -Or Database server entity â†’ Teeth:sqlmap â†’ returned vuln/evidence entities
        This lets you visually connect which hosts/services correspond to which OSINT items.

ðŸ”¹Tips, limitations & safety

        -Permissions: only scan targets you own or are authorized to test. Active scans can be intrusive and illegal without permission.

        -Performance & noise: running many transforms (nmap, sqlmap) from a GUI can be noisy; tune timeouts and scan intensity.

        -Keep Maltego & Teeth up to date: package in Kali has versions tracked in the Kali GitLab repo and pkg pages â€” check those for updates/bugs.
