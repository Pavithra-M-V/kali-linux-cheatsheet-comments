ðŸ”¹ What is hping3?

    hping3 is a command-line packet crafter/analyzer that can send custom TCP/UDP/ICMP/RAW-IP packets and display replies â€” like ping but far more flexible.

     Itâ€™s commonly used for network troubleshooting, firewall auditing, path MTU discovery, traceroute-style tests, TCP/IP stack fingerprinting and scripted packet experiments.

ðŸ”¹ Why use hping3?

    -Test firewall rules and filtering behavior by sending specific packet types (SYN, ACK, FIN, fragments, etc.) and observing replies.

    -Perform fine-grained port scanning (SYN/FIN/ACK scans) when you need more control than higher-level tools provide.

    -Measure network characteristics (response times, path MTU) and do traceroute with arbitrary protocol/flags.

    -Craft spoofed packets for research (IP spoofing, sequence manipulation) and to validate detection/mitigation logic in IDS/IPS and firewalls.

ðŸ”¹ How to install hping3 on Kali ?

Open a terminal and run:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y hping3

ðŸ”¹ Basic usage & common flags (with meaning)

        1. -1 : ICMP mode (like ping).

        2. -2 : UDP mode.

        3. -8 : RAW IP mode.

        4. -S : set SYN flag. -A ACK, -F FIN, -P PSH, -R RST, -U URG.

        5. -p <port> : destination port.

        6. -s <sport> : source port.

        7. -c <count> : number of packets to send.

        8. -i <type> : packet interval (u1000 = microseconds, u prefix; a = random).

        9. --flood : send packets as fast as possible (dangerous).

        10. -a <addr> : spoof source IP (requires root and may be filtered).

        11. -f : fragment packets.

        12. --traceroute : perform traceroute-style test (use with -S/-1/-2 etc.).

        13. --rand-source : randomize source addresses.

        14. -d <size> : set data size.
