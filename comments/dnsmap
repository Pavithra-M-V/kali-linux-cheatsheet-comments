🔹 What is dnsmap?

        1.dnsmap is a subdomain brute-forcing tool included in Kali Linux.
        2.It helps penetration testers and security researchers discover hidden subdomains of a target domain.
        3.These subdomains may host applications, test environments, or services that are not visible to the public but could be potential entry points for attackers.

🔹 Why use dnsmap?

    -To perform information gathering during penetration testing.

    -Hidden subdomains may expose:

    -Development servers (e.g., dev.example.com)

    -VPN portals (e.g., vpn.example.com)

    -Email servers (e.g., mail.example.com)

    -Increases the attack surface by revealing overlooked services.

    -Quick and lightweight tool compared to other enumeration tools.

🔹 How does dnsmap work?

-dnsmap uses a wordlist of possible subdomain names (e.g., mail, www, vpn, dev).

    -It appends each word from the list to the target domain and performs DNS resolution.

    -If a subdomain resolves successfully, it is reported as “found.”

    -Results can be saved for further analysis.

🔹 Syntax

    dnsmap <target_domain> [options]

🔹 Options

Option Description
-w <wordlist> Use a custom wordlist for subdomain brute-forcing

    -r Save results into a file (default: ./dnsmap/)

    -d <delay> Add delay between DNS queries (to bypass rate limiting)

🔹 Usage Examples

✅ Basic Scan
dnsmap example.com

Uses the built-in wordlist to find subdomains.

✅ Custom Wordlist
dnsmap example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt

Improves accuracy by using your own wordlist.

✅ Save Results
dnsmap example.com -r

Outputs discovered subdomains into the dnsmap/ directory.

🔹 Limitations:

    -Dependent on the quality of wordlists

    -Cannot perform zone transfers (use dnsenum for that)

    -May be detected and blocked by WAF/IDS`
