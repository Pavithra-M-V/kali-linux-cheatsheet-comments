ðŸ”¹ What is OSRFramework?

    -OSRFramework (Open Source Research Framework) is a set of Python-based tools designed for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).

    -It helps you gather information from publicly available sources on the internet.

    -It can check usernames, domains, phone numbers, emails, and more across hundreds of platforms.

    -It comes pre-installed (or available in repositories) on Kali Linux under OSINT tools.

ðŸ”¹ Why use OSRFramework?

    -Username reconnaissance â†’ See where a username is registered across sites.

    -Email footprinting â†’ Find services/accounts linked to an email address.

    -Domain investigation â†’ Discover related info about a domain.

    -Phone number checks â†’ Verify footprints of phone numbers in public sources.

    -OSINT automation â†’ Instead of checking each site manually, OSRFramework automates it.

Useful in:

    -Penetration testing (social engineering, phishing prep, account discovery).

    -Digital forensics (gathering intel about a target).

    -Investigations (law enforcement, journalists, cybersecurity researchers).

ðŸ”¹ How to use OSRFramework in Kali Linux

1. Installation / Check

In Kali itâ€™s usually preinstalled. Check:

    osrframework -h

If not found, install via pip:

    sudo apt install osrframework -y

2. Available tools in OSRFramework

It provides several commands:

    -usufy.py â†’ Search for a username across multiple websites.

    -mailfy.py â†’ Search for information related to email addresses.

    -searchfy.py â†’ Search in various platforms (usernames, domains, etc.).

    -domainfy.py â†’ Check domain name availability across TLDs.

    -phonefy.py â†’ Look for information about phone numbers.

3. Common usage examples

ðŸ”¹ Username search (usufy)

    Check where username john_doe exists:

        usufy.py -n john_doe


    Search multiple usernames at once:

        usufy.py -n alice,bob,charlie

ðŸ”¹ Email search (mailfy)

    Check if an email is associated with public services:

        mailfy.py -m test@example.com

ðŸ”¹Domain search (domainfy)

    Check availability of a domain across TLDs:

        domainfy.py -n mycompany -t com,net,org

ðŸ”¹ Phone number search (phonefy)

    Look for a phone number footprint:

        phonefy.py -p +919876543210

ðŸ”¹ General search (searchfy)

    Run broader OSINT lookups:

        searchfy.py -q john_doe

4. Output formats

You can export results for reporting:

Text

JSON

CSV

Example:

    usufy.py -n john_doe -o results.json

ðŸ”¹ Limitations

-Relies on publicly available info (if hidden by privacy laws/policies, wonâ€™t show).

-Some modules can be slow since they query many sources.

-Should only be used for legal and authorized investigations.
