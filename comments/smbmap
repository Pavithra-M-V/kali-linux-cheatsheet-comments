ðŸ”¹ What is smbmap?

    -smbmap is a fast, command-line tool for enumerating and interacting with SMB/CIFS shares on Windows/Linux hosts.

    -It shows available shares, access permissions (read/write/list), and allows reading/downloading files (and, when allowed, uploading).

    -Itâ€™s built for penetration testers to quickly find interesting SMB resources and misconfigurations.

ðŸ”¹ Why use smbmap?

    -Fast share enumeration across a host or subnet.

    -Identifies writable shares which attackers can abuse (drop malware, exfiltrate data).

    -Authenticated enumeration (shows more than anonymous access).

    -Non-interactive so itâ€™s easy to script and combine with other tools.

    -Good complement to tools like smbclient, enum4linux, metasploit and impacket.

ðŸ”¹ Install (Kali)

Kali usually includes smbmap. To install/update:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install smbmap

ðŸ”¹ What it does?

    -Lists available SMB shares on a host or network.

    -Shows effective permissions for each share (e.g., NO ACCESS, READ, WRITE, FULL).

    -Allows file listing, downloading, and (when permitted) uploading.

    -Supports anonymous (guest) and authenticated enumeration (username/password/domain).

    -Can search shares for filename patterns and perform recursive downloads.

ðŸ”¹ Why itâ€™s useful?

    -Quickly finds misconfigured or world-writable shares attackers could exploit.

    -Automates repetitive SMB checks across many hosts (good for red teams and audits).

    -Reveals sensitive files left in shares (backups, credentials, configs) that manual checks may miss.

    -Works well in scripts and pipelines (non-interactive output).

ðŸ”¹ Typical smbmap workflow & common commands

1. Basic share listing (anonymous):

   -smbmap -H 192.168.1.10

2. Authenticated enumeration:

   -smbmap -H 192.168.1.10 -u 'username' -p 'Password123' -d 'DOMAIN'

3. Download a file:

   -smbmap -H 192.168.1.10 -u user -p pass --download '/ShareName/path/file.docx'

4. Recursive download of an entire share:

   -smbmap -H 192.168.1.10 -u user -p pass --download --recursive 'ShareName'

5. Recursive download of an entire share:

   -smbmap -H 192.168.1.10 -u user -p pass --download --recursive 'ShareName'

ðŸ”¹ How to interpret results?

    -Look for shares with WRITE or FULL â€” these are high-risk (can drop files, malware, or exfiltrate).

    -NO ACCESS means no permission with given credentials; try authenticated creds if you have permission.

    -Share names like Backups, Finance, Public or C$ are worth special attention.

ðŸ”¹ When to use alternative tools?

    Use smbclient for interactive sessions (browse, get, put interactively).

    Use impacket scripts for advanced authenticated actions or protocol-level manipulations.

    Use enum4linux for broader Windows enumeration (users, groups, policies) in addition to shares.
