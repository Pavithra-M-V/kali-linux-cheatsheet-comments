ðŸ”¹ What is tracer?

    -DNStracer is a command-line tool used in DNS (Domain Name System) analysis.

    -It traces the DNS delegation path from the root servers down to the authoritative DNS server of a domain.

    -Unlike a normal DNS lookup (which just gives the result), dnstracer shows which DNS servers were queried at each step in the resolution chain.

ðŸ”¹ Why use DNStracer?

    -DNS Troubleshooting

    -Helps identify where DNS resolution issues occur (e.g., wrong delegation, misconfigured DNS servers).

    -Security Assessment

    -During penetration testing or reconnaissance, it helps map the DNS infrastructure of a target.

    -Can reveal hidden or misconfigured DNS servers.

    -Learning & Research

    -Useful for understanding how DNS resolution works step by step (root â†’ TLD â†’ domain authoritative servers).
