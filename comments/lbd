🔹 What is lbd?

    -lbd stands for “Load Balancer Detector.”

    -It is a simple bash script tool included in Kali Linux.

    -lbd detects whether a given domain or IP is using a load balancer.

    -It works by sending multiple requests to the target and analyzing differences in responses.

    -The detection is based on DNS, HTTP, and TCP/ICMP behavior.

🔹 Why use lbd?

    -To identify if a target website is behind a load balancer.

    -Important in penetration testing because:

    -A load balancer means requests may be distributed to multiple backend servers.

    -Exploits and attacks might behave differently depending on which backend you hit.

    -Helps in fingerprinting infrastructure during reconnaissance.

    -Useful for network admins to validate whether their load balancer setup is exposed.

🔹 How to use lbd?

1. Install (if not pre-installed in your Kali)

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install lbd

2. Syntax
   lbd <target>

3. Example

Check if example.com is behind a load balancer:

    lbd example.com

Output will say something like:

    Testing for DNS...
    Not a DNS load balancer
    Testing for HTTP...
    HTTP load balancer found

🔹 How it works (internally)

    -DNS test: Checks if multiple IPs are returned for the same hostname.

    -HTTP test: Sends multiple HTTP requests and compares responses (headers, cookies, content).

    -TCP/ICMP test: Compares TTL values and other packet-level differences.
