🌐 arp-scan in Kali Linux

📌 What is arp-scan?  
-**arp-scan** is a command-line tool for **network discovery** and **host enumeration**.

- It works by sending **ARP requests** on the local network and collecting responses.

- Unlike TCP/UDP scanners (like `nmap`), `arp-scan` works at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**, making it fast and reliable for finding devices in the same subnet.

❓ Why use arp-scan?

- ⚡ **Fast network discovery** → Finds all active hosts on a subnet in seconds.
- 🖧 **Works when ICMP (ping) is blocked** → Still finds hosts using ARP.
- 🔒 **Penetration testing** → Quickly enumerates live devices on LAN.
- 🎯 **Accurate** → ARP replies come directly from devices, so it avoids false negatives.

⚙️ How does arp-scan work?

1. **Sends ARP requests** → Asks “Who has IP X.X.X.X?” for every address in the target range.
2. **Captures ARP replies** → Devices that own those IPs respond with their **MAC address**.
3. **Displays results** → Shows IP, MAC, and (if available) vendor information.

⚠️ Limitation: ARP is **not routable** (Layer 2 only). This means `arp-scan` only works on the **local subnet** and **cannot scan beyond a router/gateway**.

🖥️ Installation (Kali Linux)  
`arp-scan` comes pre-installed in Kali Linux.  
If missing:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install arp-scan

📝 Usage Examples

1. Scan your local network (automatic interface detection)

sudo arp-scan --localnet

2. Scan with a specific interface

sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet

3. Scan a custom IP range

sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24

4. Scan specific IPs only

sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.20

5. Update vendor database

sudo arp-scan --update

🔑 Summary

What → arp-scan is a network discovery tool that uses ARP to find active devices.

Why → Fast, reliable, and works even when ping/ICMP is blocked.

How → Sends ARP requests and collects replies at Layer 2.
