ðŸ”¹ What is p0f?

    -p0f (Passive OS Fingerprinting) is a passive network reconnaissance tool in Kali Linux.

    -It identifies the operating system, uptime, network distance, NAT, and firewall presence of hosts by analyzing the characteristics of TCP/IP packets.

    -Unlike tools such as nmap, p0f does not send any packetsâ€”it only listens to traffic, making it stealthy and hard to detect.

ðŸ”¹ Why use p0f?

    -Stealthy Reconnaissance â€“ Since it doesnâ€™t generate traffic, IDS/IPS systems wonâ€™t easily detect it.

    -OS Identification â€“ Helps in penetration testing to understand the target systemâ€™s OS and network setup.

    -Network Monitoring â€“ Detects unauthorized or unexpected devices in a network.

    -Firewall/NAT Detection â€“ Identifies whether a host is behind NAT, proxy, or firewall.

    -Forensics â€“ Useful in incident response to passively analyze captured traffic (PCAP files).

ðŸ”¹ How to use p0f in Kali Linux?

1.  Installation (if not already installed)

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install p0f -y

2.  Check available interfaces

         ip a

    (Find the interface, e.g., eth0 or wlan0.)

3.  Run p0f to capture live traffic

    sudo p0f -i eth0

    -i specifies the interface.
    p0f will start analyzing packets in real-time.

4.  Analyze a PCAP file (offline mode)

        sudo p0f -r capture.pcap

Useful for forensic analysis of previously captured traffic.

5.  Save results to a log file

        sudo p0f -i eth0 -o results.log

6.  Example output

You might see:

    [+] 192.168.1.10:42315 â†’ 192.168.1.1:80
    sys: Windows 10
    dist: 0 hops
    params: no NAT/firewall
