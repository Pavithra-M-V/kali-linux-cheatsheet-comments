The amap command in Kali Linux is an application fingerprinting tool.
Itâ€™s used to identify applications and services running on open ports of a target system.

ðŸ”¹ What does amap do?

While tools like nmap can tell you what ports are open and sometimes guess the service, amap goes further:

It probes open ports with special triggers.

Tries to fingerprint the exact application/protocol behind the port.

Useful when services are running on non-standard ports (e.g., HTTP running on port 8081).

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
amap [options] <target> <port>
