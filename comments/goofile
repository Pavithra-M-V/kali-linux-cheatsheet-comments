ðŸ”¹ What is goofile

    goofile is a small open-source command-line tool that automates Google dorking for file types: it queries Google for a given domain and file extension and returns paths to matching files (e.g. pdf, doc, xls). Itâ€™s included in Kaliâ€™s toolset and there are maintained Python and Go variants on GitHub.

ðŸ”¹ Why use goofile (when itâ€™s useful)

    -Quickly discover publicly indexed documents on a target domain (reports, spreadsheets, config files, backups) during reconnaissance.

    -Automates repetitive Google dork queries so you donâ€™t manually craft site:example.com filetype:pdf searches.

    -Outputs easy-to-parse lists you can feed to downloaders (wget/curl) or follow-up analysis tools (metadata extractors, OSINT pipelines).

    -Lightweight and available in Kaliâ€™s repos â†’ easy to install in pentest/OSINT workflows.
