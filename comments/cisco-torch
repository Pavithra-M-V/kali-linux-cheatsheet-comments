What is cisco-torch?

    Cisco-Torch is a mass scanner designed specifically for discovering and fingerprinting Cisco network devices.
    It can scan for services such as Telnet, SSH, SNMP, HTTP, HTTPS, NTP, and TFTP and can also attempt dictionary-based attacks on these services.
    It is included in Kali Linux by default.

Why Use Cisco-Torch?

-Identify Cisco devices on a network.

-Perform penetration testing and security auditing.

-Detect misconfigured services or weak passwords.

-Quickly enumerate multiple services on a network.

Installation (Kali Linux)

Cisco-Torch usually comes pre-installed in Kali Linux.
If not:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install cisco-torch

Usage

Basic Scan:

    cisco-torch <target-IP> -A

Options:

<target-IP> → IP address or network range of target devices

-A → Automatically scan all supported services

-h → Display help menu

Example:

    cisco-torch 192.168.1.1 -A

Notes / Caution:

Only use on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

Results can help administrators harden Cisco devices by disabling unused services and enforcing stronger authentication.
