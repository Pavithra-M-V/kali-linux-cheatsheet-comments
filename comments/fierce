ðŸ”¹What is fierce?

    -fierce is a lightweight DNS reconnaissance/domain scanner designed to find non-contiguous IP space and hostnames for a target domain.

    -It performs things like DNS zone transfer checks, dictionary (brute) subdomain checks, and reverse lookups to help map an organizationâ€™s externally visible hostnames and networks.

    -Itâ€™s intended as a pre-cursor to deeper scanning (nmap, nikto, etc.), not an exploitation tool.

ðŸ”¹Why use it?

    -Quick domain reconnaissance: finds hidden or forgotten hosts, shadow subdomains, and gaps in IP allocation that reveal likely targets.

    -Pre-scan discovery: helps you build accurate target lists (IP ranges & hostnames) before running heavier scanners.

    -Low overhead: fast, focused DNS techniques (not full port scans) that often reveal high-value info with little network noise.

ðŸ”¹How to install?

Fierce commonly ships with Kali or is available via package managers; to install/update:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fierce

ðŸ”¹Basic usage & common flags

Run fierce -h or fierce --help on your installed version to see exact flags. Typical forms:

1. Simple scan

   fierce -dns example.com

2.Set threads (parallelism)

    fierce -dns example.com -threads 10

3.Specify a wordlist for bruteforce

    fierce -dns example.com -wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains.txt

4.Reverse lookup / range probing (find hosts in IP blocks)

    fierce -dns example.com -range 192.0.2.0/24

ðŸ”¹What it does (techniques)?

    -Zone transfer attempts (AXFR): asks authoritative name servers for full zone data (rarely allowed, but high value if successful).

    -DNS brute force / dictionary: tries common subdomain names to discover hosts not listed publicly.

    -Reverse resolution / PTR sweeps: performs reverse lookups across candidate IP ranges to find hostnames.

    -Glue / nameserver discovery: enumerates name servers and related delegations to expand the search space.

ðŸ”¹Interpreting output

    -Zone transfer success: immediate full list of hosts â€” treat as critical info (and sensitive).

    -Found hosts/subdomains: verify with dig, host, or nmap -sV to confirm and avoid false positives.

    -IP blocks discovered: use these ranges as targets for subsequent scanning (nmap, web recon).

    -No findings: doesnâ€™t mean nothing exists â€” combine with other tools (Sublist3r, subfinder, crt.sh) for broader coverage.
