ðŸ”¹ What is braa?

-braa is a SNMP mass scanner.

-It is designed to quickly query a large number of hosts to see if they respond to SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).

-Very useful in network reconnaissance and penetration testing to find devices (routers, switches, printers, servers, IoT) that have SNMP enabled.

ðŸ”¹ How it works

-SNMP is used for network management (to read info like uptime, system name, interfaces, etc.).

-Many devices run SNMP with weak or default community strings (like public or private).

-braa sends queries to multiple IPs in parallel â†’ extremely fast scanning.

ðŸ”¹ Usage Syntax

    braa <community>@<IP>/<OID>

community â†’ SNMP community string (like a password, often public)

IP â†’ target IP or network range

OID â†’ Object Identifier (defines what info you want, e.g., system name, uptime)

ðŸ”¹ Example
braa public@192.168.1.1/.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0

This queries device 192.168.1.1 with community string public for the OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 (which usually returns system description).

To scan a subnet:

braa public@192.168.1.0/24

This will try SNMP requests against all devices in the 192.168.1.x range.

ðŸ”¹ Why itâ€™s useful

-Finds devices with SNMP exposed

-Detects misconfigured routers/switches

-Helps pentesters expand their attack surface (since SNMP can reveal lots of system info)
