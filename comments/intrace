ðŸ”¹ What is InTrace?

    -InTrace is a traceroute-like application that enumerates IP hops by piggybacking on existing TCP connections (rather than using ICMP/UDP probes).

     -It can inspect hops for connections initiated from the local host or from remote hosts and supports IPv6.

ðŸ”¹ Why use InTrace?

    -Network reconnaissance â€” map intermediate hops along an existing TCP session (useful when ICMP is filtered).


    -Firewall / filtering analysis â€” because it uses TCP flows, it can sometimes reveal network paths where traditional traceroute is blocked.


    -Useful for pentesters and network defenders wanting more nuance about how TCP traffic traverses a target network (note: only use on systems/networks you are authorized to test).

ðŸ”¹ How to install InTrace ?

InTrace is packaged in Kali and can be installed with apt:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install intrace

ðŸ”¹ Basic usage / flags

Run intrace without args or check -h/--help to see usage.

    intrace <-h hostname> [-p <port>] [-d <debuglevel>] [-s <payloadsize>] [-6]

ðŸ”¹ Common flags:

    1. -h <hostname> : target host to trace (required).

    2. -p <port> : TCP port to piggyback on (e.g., 80, 443).

    3. -d <level> : debug/log verbosity.

    4. -s <payloadsize> : size of the probe payload.

    5. -6 : use IPv6.

ðŸ”¹ Example commands (practical)

1. Show help:

   intrace -h

2. Trace hops toward example.com using TCP port 443:

   sudo intrace -h example.com -p 443

3. Increase verbosity for debugging:

   sudo intrace -h example.com -p 443 -d 2

4. IPv6 example:

   sudo intrace -h ipv6.example.com -p 443 -6
