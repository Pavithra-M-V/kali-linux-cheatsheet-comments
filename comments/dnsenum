    -Retrieving host IP addresses (A records) 🌐

    -Finding name servers (NS records) 📡

    -Getting mail exchange servers (MX records) 📧

    -Performing AXFR zone transfers to get domain data 🔄

    -Reverse DNS lookups on network ranges🔄

Why Use dnsenum? 🎯

    -Comprehensive DNS information gathering for security testing

    -Automates and speeds up DNS reconnaissance with multithreading

    -Helpful for discovering hidden subdomains and mail servers
