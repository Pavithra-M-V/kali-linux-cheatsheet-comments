ðŸ”¹What is fragrouter?

    fragrouter (often discussed together with the fragroute/fragrouter family) is a packet-manipulation/interception tool used to modify, fragment, delay, reorder, or otherwise mutate packets as they pass through a machine.

Common capabilities include:

    -Splitting IP packets into unusual fragments (varying fragment sizes / offsets).

    -Rewriting or dropping TCP/UDP payloads.

    -Delaying or reordering packets.

    -Acting as a transparent proxy/router that applies a set of rules to traffic in transit.

    -Itâ€™s primarily used to test how firewalls, IDS/IPS, and hosts handle unusual or malformed traffic and to demonstrate reassembly/fragmentation issues.

ðŸ”¹Why use fragrouter?

    -Security testing / IDS evasion research â€” shows whether network devices reassemble or inspect fragments correctly; can reveal gaps where malicious payloads pass because the device fails to reassemble/inspect correctly.

    -Firewall/ACL validation â€” helps validate that middleboxes enforce policies correctly even under fragmented/malformed traffic.

    -Protocol resilience testing â€” finds bugs in TCP/IP stacks or applications that mishandle fragments or out-of-order data.

    -Educational / lab work â€” useful for learning about IP fragmentation, packet reassembly, and network defensive gaps.

ðŸ”¹How it works (high level)?

    -fragrouter sits on the packet path (either as a gateway, transparent bridge, or proxy).

    -It intercepts packets and applies a rule set (fragmentation rules, drop rules, rewrite rules, timing rules).

    -For fragmentation, it splits a single IP packet into multiple fragments with chosen lengths and offsets. The target host later reassembles the fragments â€” the behavior during reassembly (and what intermediate devices see) is what the tester observes.

    -For mutation, it can change bytes in payloads, tamper TCP flags, change sequencing, or insert delays to provoke edge cases.
