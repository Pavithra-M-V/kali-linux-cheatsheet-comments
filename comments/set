üîπ What is SET in Kali Linux?

    -SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit) is an open-source penetration testing framework designed for social engineering attacks.

    -It comes pre-installed in Kali Linux and is mainly used to simulate attacks where the weakest link is human behavior instead of just technical vulnerabilities.

    -Developed by Dave Kennedy (TrustedSec), SET is one of the most powerful tools for phishing, credential harvesting, and payload delivery.

üîπ Why use SET?

    -SET is used because:

    -Realistic attack simulations: Helps penetration testers and organizations understand how attackers exploit human trust.

    -Training & awareness: IT teams and employees can be trained to recognize and defend against social engineering attacks.

    -Multiple attack vectors: It supports many types of attacks (phishing emails, fake websites, malicious payloads, etc.).

    -Customizable & automated: Makes it easier to craft realistic attacks without needing to code everything manually.

üîπ How to use SET in Kali Linux?

1. Launch SET

Open terminal and type:

    sudo setoolkit

(If not installed: sudo apt install set)

You‚Äôll see a menu-driven interface.

2. Main Attack Vectors in SET

Some of the most used options are:

    - Social-Engineering Attacks

    - Spear Phishing Attack Vectors (craft & send malicious emails).

    - Website Attack Vectors (clones websites to capture credentials).

    - Infectious Media Generator (creates malicious USB/CD payloads).

    - Penetration Testing (Fast-Track)

    - Quick payloads and exploits.

    - Third Party Modules

    - Extra attack plugins from the community.

3. Example: Credential Harvesting Attack

Steps:

Start SET:

    sudo setoolkit

Choose:

1. Social-Engineering Attacks
2. Website Attack Vectors
3. Credential Harvester Attack Method

Select Site Cloner option.

    -Enter the URL of the site you want to clone (e.g., Facebook, Gmail).

    -SET will host a fake site on your local IP.

    -When the victim visits the fake page and enters login info ‚Üí credentials are captured in the terminal/log file.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note

    -SET is a legal penetration testing tool.

    -Only use it on systems/networks you own or have permission to test.

    Using it on unsuspecting people without consent is illegal and unethical.
