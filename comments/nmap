What is Nmap?

    Nmap is an open-source network discovery and security-auditing tool.
    At a high level it can:

        Discover hosts on a network (who’s up).

        Find open ports on hosts.

        Detect services and versions running on those ports.

        Attempt OS fingerprinting (guess operating system).

        Run scripts (NSE) to perform discovery, vulnerability checks, brute force attempts, and more.

Key components:

    -Core port-scanning engine (SYN, connect, UDP, etc.).

    -OS & service fingerprinting database.

    -Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) — hundreds of scripts for extra enumeration and vuln checks.

    -Multiple output formats (normal, XML, grepable).

Why use Nmap?

Use cases and benefits:

    -Network discovery — map your network topology or find rogue devices.

    -Security scanning — find exposed services and potential attack surface.

    -Inventory & asset management — what services/versions are running where.

    -Vulnerability reconnaissance — with NSE scripts you can identify known issues.

    -Penetration testing — first step in many assessments.

    -Troubleshooting — check if a service/port is reachable.

Limitations:

    -Not an exploit tool — Nmap finds issues; it rarely exploits them (some NSE scripts can be intrusive).

    -Noisy — many scans are obvious to IDS/IPS.

    -False positives/negatives — treat results as clues, verify manually.

How to use Nmap ?

1. Check/install

   Kali usually has it preinstalled. Check:

   nmap --version

If missing:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nmap -y

2. Basic host discovery

   Ping-scan (which hosts are up) on a /24:

   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

3. Basic port scans

   SYN (stealth) scan — common and fast (requires root):

   sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.10

TCP connect (no raw sockets needed):

    nmap -sT 192.168.1.10

UDP scan (slower and noisier):

    sudo nmap -sU 192.168.1.10

Scan specific ports or range:

    nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
    nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.1.10   # full TCP port range (long)

4. Service & version detection

   Detect service and version strings:

   sudo nmap -sV 192.168.1.10

5. OS detection

   Try to determine OS:

   sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.10

6. Aggressive scan (combines several checks)

   Noisy but thorough:

   sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.10
